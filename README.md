Here's a glimpse of my work in multiple languages:

- **Python:**
  ```python
  def create_model():
      model = Sequential([
          Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),
          MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
          Dropout(0.25),
          Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
          MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
          Dropout(0.25),
          Flatten(),
          Dense(128, activation='relu'),
          Dropout(0.5),
          Dense(10, activation='softmax')
      ])
      return model
  
  model = create_model()

- **C#:**
```csharp
using System;

namespace HelloWorld {
    class Program {
        static void Main(string[] args) {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
